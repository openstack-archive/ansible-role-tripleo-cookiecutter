# ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter

Cookiecutter template for a compliant OpenStack TripleO Ansible role

## Installation

Install [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/) either from source, pip or package if it exists

## Usage

There are two ways to create the boilerplate for the ansible role.

### Locally

  1. Clone locally the [ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter](https://opendev.org/openstack/ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter/) repository.
  2. Run `cookiecutter /path/to/cloned/repo`

### Remotely (ie. using a git repo)

  1. Run `cookiecutter https://opendev.org/openstack/ansible-role-tripleo-cookiecutter.git`

## Testing

  1. Run 'tox -eansible-lint' to test any change in the cookiecutter. It will generate a role and make sure it works and lint is fine.

## What's next

Add any additional tags your role may need to be properly identified on Ansible Galaxy in meta/main.yml.
Populate your project's README with variable documentation and example playbooks.

Once role is ready, make the proper patch to openstack-infra and wait for the reviews to do the rest.
